                <p>I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

                    I'm curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and my Instapaper “Starred” list will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds.

                    Website Development
                </h1>
                <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                    Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
                    
                    For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

                        App Designing
                    </h1>
                    <p>Designing applications for desktop and laptop computers poses special challenges: facilitating intricate tasks and workflows, enabling users to comprehend and manage complex data, and accommodating a rich variety of user roles, needs, and processes. Effective design and implementation of applications can have profound, positive implications on productivity, efficiency, accuracy, and satisfaction in a huge range of environments: creative studios, healthcare, home entertainment and productivity, manufacturing, call centers, supply-chain management, and many more.

                        In this seminar, we explore interaction-design patterns found in a range of desktop applications, from web-based configurators, to creative and productivity software, all the way to complex native desktop apps built for expert professionals with specialized domain experience.  We review design considerations for cloud-based webapps and Software as a Service (SaaS), as well as native apps built for Windows and macOS. In addition, we demonstrate key workflow concepts for different task types, and we present guidelines for specific application types. We’ll cover how to understand users’ needs, goals, and tasks, and how to enable users to not only use your app immediately, but also learn advanced functionality over time</p>
